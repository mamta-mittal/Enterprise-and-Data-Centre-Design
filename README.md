# Enterprise-and-Data-Centre-Design
Design done as part of Enterprise and Data Centre Networking Module in Post Graduate Diploma Course.
LANs at Data Centers, Head Office and Sligo Branch Office in different cities were connected together to form a WAN so that they can communicate with each other. Leased Lines,which are secured private dedicated lines were used to connect the three primary locations. Separate Internet connection from AirSpeed and Eir has been provided to DC1, DC2, Head Office and Sligo branch as primary and backup links. These connections terminate on FortiGate Perimeter Firewalls which are recommended to be used in High Availability (HA) mode. The firewalls are connected to Routers which are advised to be configured in redundancy mode using HSRP. Branch sites were connected to Data Centre using IPSec VPN tunnel. Client to Site VPN or Remote User VPN was configured to allow remote access to users who are away from office, either travelling or working from home or a different location.
